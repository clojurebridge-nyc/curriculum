## Starting a terminal

For these instructions, and for much of the class, you will need to have a terminal, or command line, open. This is a text-based interface to talk to your computer, and you can open it by running Terminal.app, which is found under `/Applications/Utilities`. If you have never used the terminal before, you may want to spend some time [reading up on command-line basics](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics).

Go ahead and open your terminal now. It should look something like this:

![blank terminal](img/os_x/blank_terminal.png)

The prompt (where you will type your commands) may look different: it usually shows the computer name and user name, as well as the folder or directory you are currently in.

For the rest of this setup, I will tell you to run commands in your terminal. When I say that, I mean "type the command into the terminal and press the Return key."

## Install Git

To see if you have git installed type in: `git --version` If you have `git version 1.9.3 (Apple Git-50)` or above you should be fine.

If not, visit [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/). Click "Downloads for Mac". The Git installer may begin downloading automatically. If it does not, click the manual download link. Once the download has finished, open __~/Downloads__ in Finder and double-click the downloaded file (named something like __git-2.0.1-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg__). This will mount the disk image and open a new Finder window. Double-click the installer package (named something like __git-2.0.1-intel-universal-snow-leopard.pkg__). You may be told that the installer can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. If so, click "OK", then right-click (or control-click) the file and select "Open" from the contextual menu. You may be warned again that the installer is from an unidentified developer, but this time you'll have the option to click "Open". Do so. This will launch the installer. Follow its directions, and enter your password when prompted to do so. Once you have finished this process it's safe to unmount the disk image (by clicking the eject button in the Finder sidebar) and delete the file from the Downloads folder.

## Configure Git

If you've used Git before then you should already have user.name and user.email configured.
Otherwise, type this in the terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Actual Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Actual Email"
```
TIP: Use the same email address for git, github, and ssh.

Verify by typing this in the terminal:

`git config --get user.name`
Expected result:
`your name`

`git config --get user.email`
Expected result:
`your email address`

## Making sure Java is installed


> If you have OS X version 10.11 (El Capitan), you don't have Java installed.
> You need to install Java as well.
> Download Java from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html> and follow the instruction.
> If you have a trouble, the article, <http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/17/how-to-install-java-in-os-x-el-capitan/>, may help.


Run `java -version` in your terminal. If you do not have Java installed, OS X will prompt you to install it. Follow all of the directions OS X gives you, then return to this part of the tutorial and run `java -version` again.

If Java is installed, you will see something like this in your terminal:

![Java version](img/os_x/java_version.png)

The details of Java's version may differ from what you see above; that is perfectly fine.

## Install Leiningen

Leiningen is a tool used on the command line to manage Clojure projects.

To install `lein`, execute the following commands in your terminal; you will be prompted to enter your password for at least the first command starting with `sudo` (The `%` character is a typical commandline prompt, don't type it):

```bash
% curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein > lein
% sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
% sudo mv lein /usr/local/bin/lein
% sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lein
```
Check that you can now see the command:
```bash
% which lein
/usr/local/bin/lein
```
If you don't see `/usr/local/bin/lein` as above, do this next:
```bash
% export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```
Now run `which lein` and you should see the `lein` command.

After you set up Leiningen as above, run the `lein version` command. This should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. If it completes successfully, you are golden! If not, ask an instructor for help.

## Install Nightcode

Go to the [Nightcode release site](http://github.com/oakes/Nightcode/releases).

>**Note:** Do NOT go to the main Nightcode page and download the most recent version. The most recent version is Nightcode 2.0.1 (released July 2016), but we will be using a slightly older one (Nightcode 1.3.2) because the new one just came out and might be a little unstable. Plus the user interfaces of the two versions are a bit different, and the current ClojureBridge instructional materials are written for the older one.

On the [Nightcode release site](http://github.com/oakes/Nightcode/releases), you should see version numbers and links to download specific version of Nightcode.

Scroll down to the heading "1.3.2", and click the download link labeled `nightcode-1.3.2-standalone.jar`.

Once the download is finished, we want to start the editor.

To start it up, go into your Downloads folder (or wherever you save files from your browser) and run the `nightcode-1.3.2-standalone.jar` file using the `java` command.

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/
java -jar nightcode-1.3.2-standalone.jar
```

## Test your setup

You have set up Java, Leiningen, Nightcode, and Git on your computer--all the tools you will need for this workshop. Before starting, we need to test them out.

#### Cloning out github repository

Go to your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge
```

This will clone `welcometoclojurebridge` repository which includes
sample Clojure apps.
Your terminal should look similar to this picture:

![Testing git clone](img/os_x/testing-git-clone.png)

#### Testing `lein repl`

Then run the command:

```bash
cd welcometoclojurebridge
```

This will take you to the directory with the source code. After that completes, run:

```bash
lein repl
```

This could take a long time, and will download many other pieces of code apps rely on. You should see lines that start with `Retrieving ...` on your screen. When it finishes, your terminal should look like the following:

![Testing lein repl](img/os_x/testing-lein-repl.png)

This is starting a REPL, which we will learn about soon. It's a special terminal for Clojure. At the REPL prompt, type `(+ 1 1)` and press Return. Did you get the answer `2` back? You will learn more about that in the course. For now, press the Control button and D button on your keyboard together (abbreviated as Ctrl+D). This should take you out of the Clojure REPL and back to your normal terminal prompt. Then, the terminal will show you the following message: `user=> Bye for now!`


#### Testing Nightcode

If Nightcode isn't started yet or closed, open it by typing the command on terminal:

```bash
java -jar nightcode-1.3.2-standalone.jar
```

At the bottom left of the screen, type `(+ 1 1)` into the window. It should look like the following image:

<img src="img/nightcode-repl.png" alt="Testing Nightcode" width="500">

If you see the result, 2, that worked, great!


#### Testing apps

Now we will open and run the sample Clojure apps in Nightcode.
On the top left corner, click "Import" then find the directory,
`welcometoclojurebridge`, which was created when you ran
`git clone` command. Click "Open."
In the project directory tree on the left, click on `src` - `welcometoclojurebridge` - `core.clj`. The `core.clj` file will be opened on the right side.
This is a Clojure program.

<img src="img/nightcode-click-import.png" alt="Testing apps - click import" width="500">
<img src="img/nightcode-open-project.png" alt="Testing apps - open welcometoclojurebridge" width="500">
![Testing apps - core.clj](img/nightcode-welcometoclojurebridge-core.png)


The next step is to run the code shown in the window.
Click "Run with REPL" on the bottom of the right side.
It may take a while.
Eventually, repl will start and show a prompt on the bottom of the window.
Once, you see the prompt, click "Reload" button.


![Testing apps - start repl](img/nightcode-welcometoclojurebridge-run-with-repl.png)
![Testing apps - repl started](img/nightcode-repl-started.png)
![Testing apps - repl reload](img/nightcode-repl-reload.png)


You should see a fun welcome message.

![Testing apps - welcome](img/testing-welcomeclojurebridge.png)


Let's try one more sample.
In the directory tree on the left, click on
`welcometoclojurebridge` - `src` - `clojurebridge-turtle` -
`walk.clj`. The `walk.clj` file will open on the right side.
Like we did before, click "Reload" button.

![Testing apps - walk code](img/nightcode-turtle-walk.png)
![Testing apps - walk reload](img/nightcode-turtle-walk-reload.png)


An initial image of the turtles app should pop up.
A small triangle on the center is the *turtle*.


Type `(forward 40)` on the repl at the bottom of the window.
You should see the turtle moved upword:

![Testing apps - forward](img/nightcode-turtle-forward-40.png)



#### Success!

Congratulations! You have opened and run your first Clojure apps, and
your install and setup are all completed!


If you want to know what the turtle (*a small triangle*) can do,
