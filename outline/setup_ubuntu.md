## Starting a terminal

For these instructions, and for much of the class, you will need to have a terminal, or command line, open. This is a text-based interface to talk to your computer, and you can open it by clicking "Dash Home" and typing `Terminal`. You can also open a terminal at any time by pressing `CTRL-ALT-T`. If you have never used the terminal before, you may want to spend some time [reading up on command-line basics](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics).

Go ahead and open your terminal now. It should look something like this:

![blank terminal](img/ubuntu/blank_terminal.png)

The prompt (where you will type your commands) may look different: it usually shows the computer name and user name, as well as the folder or directory you are currently in.

For the rest of this setup, I will tell you to run commands in your terminal. When I say that, I mean "type the command into the terminal and press the Return key."

## Installing Git

See if you already have Git installed with `git version`.
If the `git` command is not found, install it with this command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

## Configure Git

If you've used Git before then you should already have user.name and user.email configured.
Otherwise, type this in the terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Actual Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Actual Email"
```

TIP: Use the same email address for git, github, and ssh.

Verify by typing this in the terminal:

`git config --get user.name`
Expected result:
`your name`

`git config --get user.email`
Expected result:
`your email address`


## Making sure Java is installed

Run `java -version` in your terminal. If you do not have Java installed, Ubuntu will prompt you to install it. It should look something like this:

![no java](img/ubuntu/no_java.png)

Follow all of the directions Ubuntu gives you, selecting the package "openjdk-7-jre" then return to this part of the tutorial and run `java -version` again.

If Java is installed, you will see something like this in your terminal:

![Java version](img/ubuntu/java_version.png)

The details of Java's version may differ from what you see above; that is perfectly fine.

## Install Leiningen

Leiningen is a tool used on the command line to manage Clojure projects.

Go to the [Leiningen website](http://leiningen.org/). You will see a link to the `lein` script under the "Install" heading. Right-click that link and choose "Save Link As...". Save it in your Downloads directory.

![Leiningen site](img/leiningen_site.png)
![Leiningen site](img/lein_install.png)

After that, run the following commands in your terminal. You will be prompted to enter your password.

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv ~/Downloads/lein* /usr/local/bin/lein
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lein
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

After you run the above commands, run the `lein version` command. It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. If it completes successfully, you are golden! If not, ask an instructor for help.

## Install Nightcode

Go to the [Nightcode release site](http://github.com/oakes/Nightcode/releases).

>**Note:** Do NOT go to the main Nightcode page and download the most recent version. The most recent version is Nightcode 2.0.1 (released July 2016), but we will be using a slightly older one (Nightcode 1.3.2) because the new one just came out and might be a little unstable. Plus the user interfaces of the two versions are a bit different, and the current ClojureBridge instructional materials are written for the older one.

On the [Nightcode release site](http://github.com/oakes/Nightcode/releases), you should see version numbers and links to download specific version of Nightcode.

Scroll down to the heading "1.3.2", and click the download link labeled `nightcode-1.3.2-standalone.jar`.

Once the download is finished, we want to start the editor.

To start it up, go into your Downloads folder (or wherever you save files from your browser) and run the `nightcode-1.3.2-standalone.jar` file using the `java` command.

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/
java -jar nightcode-1.3.2-standalone.jar
```

## Testing your setup

You have set up Java, Leiningen, Nightcode, and Git on your computer--all the tools you will need for this course. Before starting, we need to test them out.

#### Cloning out github repository

Go to your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge
```

This will clone `welcometoclojurebridge` repository which includes sample Clojure apps.
Your terminal should look similar to this picture:

![Testing git clone](img/ubuntu/testing-git-clone.png)

#### Testing `lein repl`

Then run the command:

```bash
cd welcometoclojurebridge
```

This will take you to the directory with the source code. After that completes, run:

```bash
lein repl
```

This could take a long time, and will download many other pieces of code it relies on. You should see lines that start with `Retrieving ...` on your screen. When it finishes, your terminal should look like the following:

![Testing lein repl](img/ubuntu/testing-lein-repl.png)

This is starting a REPL, which we will learn about soon. It's a
special terminal for Clojure. At the REPL prompt, type `(+ 1 1)` and
press Return. Did you get the answer `2` back? You will learn more
about that in the course. For now, press the Control button and D
button on your keyboard together (abbreviated as Ctrl+D). This should
take you out of the Clojure REPL and back to your normal terminal
prompt. Then, the terminal will show you the following message: `user=> Bye for now!`


#### Testing Nightcode

If Nightcode isn't started yet or closed, open it by typing the command on terminal:

```bash
java -jar nightcode-1.3.2-standalone.jar
```

At the bottom left of the screen, type `(+ 1 1)` into the window. It should look like the following image:

<img src="img/nightcode-repl.png" alt="Testing Nightcode" width="500">

If you see the result, 2, that worked, great!


### Testing apps

Now we will open and run the sample Clojure apps in Nightcode.
On the top left corner, click "Import" then find the directory,
`welcometoclojurebridge`, which was created when you ran
`git clone` command. Click "Open."
In the project directory tree on the left, click on `src` - `welcometoclojurebridge` - `core.clj`. The `core.clj` file will be opened on the right side.
This is a Clojure program.

<img src="img/nightcode-click-import.png" alt="Testing apps - click import" width="500">
<img src="img/nightcode-open-project.png" alt="Testing apps - open welcometoclojurebridge" width="500">
![Testing apps - core.clj](img/nightcode-welcometoclojurebridge-core.png)


The next step is to run the code shown in the window.
Click "Run with REPL" on the bottom of the right side.
It may take a while.
Eventually, repl will start and show a prompt on the bottom of the window.
Once, you see the prompt, click "Reload" button.


![Testing apps - start repl](img/nightcode-welcometoclojurebridge-run-with-repl.png)
![Testing apps - repl started](img/nightcode-repl-started.png)
![Testing apps - repl reload](img/nightcode-repl-reload.png)


You should see a fun welcome message.

![Testing apps - welcome](img/testing-welcomeclojurebridge.png)


Let's try one more sample.
In the directory tree on the left, click on
`welcometoclojurebridge` - `src` - `clojurebridge-turtle` -
`walk.clj`. The `walk.clj` file will open on the right side.
Like we did before, click "Reload" button.

![Testing apps - walk code](img/nightcode-turtle-walk.png)
![Testing apps - walk reload](img/nightcode-turtle-walk-reload.png)


An initial image of the turtles app should pop up.
A small triangle on the center is the *turtle*.


Type `(forward 40)` on the repl at the bottom of the window.
You should see the turtle moved upword:

![Testing apps - forward](img/nightcode-turtle-forward-40.png)



#### Success!

Congratulations! You have opened and run your first Clojure apps, and
your install and setup are all completed!

If you want to know what the turtle (*a small triangle*) can do,
